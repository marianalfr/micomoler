# Micomoler.


This is another old personal project of mine. When I was at uni, a group of friends and I founded a furniture design studio. 
In 2013 we showcased our designs at Salone Satellite within Salone del Mobile di Milano. I made this website as part of our branding and it still live.
I got very creative with this project because I was taking a very basic course on html and css at the time, and I decided to explore with css animations and transformations.
